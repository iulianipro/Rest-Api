# Rest-Api
A simple function to create REST API 

This code sets up a basic REST API with two endpoints: a root endpoint ("/") that returns "Hello, World!" and an API data endpoint ("/api/data") that returns "API data endpoint".

To run this code, you'll need to have the necessary dependencies installed and configured. You can create a new ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio or use the .NET CLI to create and run the project.
